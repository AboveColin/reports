# Field Research Report
Discord Python Report that will post Research for Pokemon Go. For use with MAD Scanner. 

DO NOT INSTALL ON SAME ENVIRONMENT AS SCANNER.


**Optional Pokemon Filter**

Pokemon filters can be in an area.ini file or config.ini file. Takes 3 digit pokedex numbers to display only those pokemon. If left empty all pokemon encounters will be displayed. An area.ini file will surpass the config.ini file for any settings including a blank dex_number list. If this is not needed it can be commented out in the area.ini file for the config.ini values to be used.

**config.ini File Edits**

You can edit the config.ini file to pick which items you would want in your report with true/false statements. You can also adjust the stardust for research. Stardust amounts will show anything Greater then and equal to the amount you enter.

**Optional Arguments:**

Running without any arguments will run the report with static images and no file/stops checks using the config.ini file information.

-c, --check will check the area for the amount of pokestops vs amount of research tasks before posting and perform a filecheck to see if a report has already ran today. CRON use for running every X amount of minutes to autopost after all stops have scanned for research. Do not use with -s.

-a, --area allows to pass optional area, webhook, areanames or author. If this is not used the config.ini defaults will be used.

-g, --gif will load Animated Gif Sprites for pokemon vs the standard images.

-s, --safe Will perform a file check only to see if a report has already ran today. CRON Use as a fail safe run at a specific time if some stops havenâ€™t reported research. Do no use with -c.
